= Babun - a Windows shell you will love!

Website of the project.

== Building the site from source

=== Install Awestruct


On OSX only: install Developer Tools

 $ xcode-select --install

Then, install http://rvm.io[RVM]. 

 $ curl -#L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

Next, install ruby:

 $ rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p545

Next, setup an RVM gemset for working with the Asciidoctor site:

 $ rvm use 1.9.3@asciidoctor-site --create 

At this point, you could install Awestruct directly, but since the site build has some additional dependencies, it's best to let bundler handle the installation. Bundler will also ensure that you are using the correct versions of each gem when you run Awestruct.

 $ bundle install

You're done!

== Deploying the website

 $ cd scripts
 $ ./all.sh

Babun 1.0.1 is out! 

There's a lot of goodies that have been included in this release - the most importants ones are:

* There is no interference with the existing Cygwin installations.
* You may have whicespace or accent characters in your Windows username.
* You may install to a custom folder using the install.bat /t "d:\babun_folder" switch.
* You may install babun having the %HOME% env variable set (babun will reuse the user's Windows home folder)
* You can easily pin babun to taskbar

If you already have babun 1.0.0 just invoke "babun update" and enjoy the newest version!

More details coming up soon!

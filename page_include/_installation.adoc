=== Installation

Just download the http://projects.reficio.org/babun/babun-dist.zip[dist file], unzip it and run the install.bat script. After a few minutes babun starts automatically.
The application will be installed to the +%USER_HOME%\.babun+ directory.

==== IMPORTANT: Known issues

WARNING: You may try to install babun if you already have Cygwin installed, but it may not always work. We would appreciate feedback on that issue since we cannot reproduce it.

WARNING: Babun installation will fail if you have a "whitespace" in username or userprofile - it is a known Cygwin's issue: http://cygwin.com/faq.html#faq.setup.name-with-space[FAQ]. A fix is coming that will abort the installation in such cases or let the user choose a different folder.
